    "## Relating Obesity to Diabetes\n",
    "+ The scatter graph shows that there is a **positive relation** between obesity and diabetes.\n",
    "+ This realations is much **stronger than the relation between poverty and obesity**.\n",
    "+ This was expected as obesity is known as a main cause of diabetes B.\n",
    "+ This research was used to get an **example of a closely related pair of data sets**.\n",
    "+ The scatter plot still is not as linear as one would expect. Obesity is just one factor of many for diabetes."
